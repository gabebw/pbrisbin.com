## About

A simple pacman-like interface to the AUR written in bash.

Aurget is designed to make the AUR convenient and speed up tedious
actions. The user can decide to search, download, build, and/or
install packages consistently through a config file or dynamically by 
passing arguments on the commandline.

The user can also choose to edit all or no PKGBUILDs, and enable or
disable auto-dependency-resolution through the same means.

Checking dependencies comes with risks because PKGBUILDs need to be
sourced. Please, if you're worried about this, be sure to view all
PKGBUILDs before proceeding or use the config file or commandline
options to disable this check from occurring and remove any
associated risk.

You have been warned.

The help:

    usage: aurget [ -v | -h | -S* [ --options ] [ -- ] <arguments> ]
      options:

            -S  <package>   process <package> using your default sync_mode

            -Sd <package>   download <package>
            -Sb <package>   download and build <package>
            -Sy <package>   download, build, and install <package>

            -Su             process available upgrades using your default sync_mode

            -Sdu            download available upgrades
            -Sbu            download and build available upgrades
            -Syu            download, build, and install available upgrades

            -Ss  <term>     search aur for <term>
            -Ssq <term>     search aur for <term>, print only package names
            -Sp  <package>  print the PKGBUILD for <package>
            -Si  <package>  print extended info for <package>

            --rebuild       always rebuild (ignore your cache)

            --devel         only affects -Su, add all development packages

            --deps          resolve dependencies
            --nodeps        don't resolve dependencies

            --edit          prompt to edit all pkgbuilds
            --noedit        don't prompt to edit any pkgbuilds

            --discard       discard source files after building
            --nodiscard     don't discard source files after building

            --nocolor       disable colorized output
            --noconfirm     auto-answer y to all prompts

            --ignore '<package> <package> <...>'
                            add additional packages to be ignored

            --mopt '-opt -opt ...'
                            add additional options to the build command

            --popt '-opt -opt ...'
                            add additional options to the install command

            -v, --version   display version info
            -h, --help      display this

            --option=value  set config <option> as <value> for this run only

<div class="note">
The `--option=value` flag is powerful in that it can greatly customize 
an aurget command for specific packages that require it (like an 
nvidia-beta / nvidia-utils-beta upgrade which requires <abbr 
title="aurget -Sy --nodeps --popt '-d -f'  &quot;--makepkg_command='makepkg -f 
-d --noconfirm'&quot; nvidia-beta nvidia-utils-beta">additional 
`pacman` and `makepkg` options</abbr> to complete). Beware that this command 
sets the variable it's passed even if that's not a "valid" variable, so 
it may have unintended consequences (i.e. if you pass `--HOME=foo` or 
something silly).

## Installation

Install the AUR package [here][aur].

Follow development via my git repo [here][git].

## Bugs and Features

If you've found a bug or want to request a feature, please let me know 
via email. If you can implement what you're looking for, please fork my 
git repo and send me a pull request.

Aurget does not and will not search or install from official repos. This 
is by design and will not be implemented even if you offer a patch.

Use packer or clyde if this is what you're looking for.

## Known Bugs

If you pass an aur package before one of its dependencies as the targets 
to aurget, it will not reorder the targets and the installation will 
probably fail on the first package. Accounting for this would require a 
lot of unneeded code. The `makepkg` error will tell you the dep is not 
satisfied and it's easy enough to adjust your targets and run it again.

In a somewhat related way, it is possible, depending on the structure of 
multi-level dependencies, for aurget to miss a dependency. As an 
example:

    # coding specifically for this scenario:

        pkg
        `-- depends
            |-- foo
            |-- bar
            |   `- depends
            |      `- baz
            `-- baz

    # would break this one (and vice versa):

        pkg
        `-- depends
            |-- foo
            |-- baz
            `-- bar
                `- depends
                   `- baz

Aurget will filter out the duplicate dependency (baz), but in one of the 
cases it will be placed behind the package that needs it and `makepkg` 
will fail. I consider this improper packaging and have decided to not 
try and code around it. If you encounter this scenario, I encourage you 
to post a comment on the aur page of the parent package explaining that 
baz is unneeded in his `depends` array because it's pulled in by bar.

Some aur packages report a bad url to their tarball in the JSON 
interface. Aurget checks the downloaded file, if it's not a valid 
archive, it will try 
`http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/$package/$package.tar.gz` as a 
fallback. If neither the JSON url nor the fallback url provide a valid 
archive, well, there's not much I can do.
